                <p>
                    Hi!
                    <img src="sunset.jpg" alt="">
                </p>

                <p>
                    Welcome to my website, blog, whatever you want to call it...

                    The purpose of this is to share a
                    little about myself with anyone who is interested. Here, I will (try to)
                    frequently post about different areas that interest me.

                </p>

                <!-- <p>
                The blog is divided into 4 areas:
            </p>
            <ol id="list">
                <li>
                    In the first one, About Me, I will share facts about my life, my origins,
                    and my closest people.
                </li>
                <li>The Finance section is supposed to be a little more formal and professional since this is what I
                    studied
                    at college and what I work with. Here you will find my thoughts about different topics, articles,
                    and
                    books. These posts range from personal finance, to business, to economics.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Journal section is supposed to be the opposite of the Finance section. This is a very
                    informal
                    area where I will share random feelings and thoughts about basically anything.
                </li>
                <li>

                    The last
                    area is about books, movies, or tv shows that I recommend and my opinions on them.
                </li>
            </ol> -->
                <p>
                    This is
                    basically a place where I will make my life available to friends, family,
                    employers, colleagues, and people that I don't even know. I strongly believe that everybody has
                    something
                    valuable to share to the world, and everyone can learn from each other. So, don't take what I post
                    here
                    as an absolute truth. Actually, I just want to share how I perceive some topics that are important
                    to me
                    and what I've
                    learned so far in my short journey. I hope that you like the content, or that at least I make any
                    sort
                    of positive impact in the way you see the world!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also like to know more about you, so you're always more than welcome to contact me on:
                </p>
