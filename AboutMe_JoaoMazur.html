                On a Monday, August 17th, 1998 I was born in Curitiba, Brazil where I lived with my brother Luís and my
                parents until 2003. During these 5 years we lived in the first floor of a small 2 bedroom apartment in
                the
                central location of the city. My parents always described me as a really calm and obedient kid, the
                opposite
                from my brother. Mom says that she used to always be running after my brother so she would forget about
                me.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003, the 4 of us and our dog moved to Colombo, where my family lives until now. The new house is 30
                minutes away from our old apartment but despite the short distance, the new place was the complete
                opposite of our old one. Now we were living in a small farm, in an Italian rural area known
                for producing wines. Here I lived the best years of my life, I was in constant contact with nature,
                friends,
                and animals. We had horses, cows, chickens, and lots of dogs (19 - to be precise, not counting the many
                times that they had puppies). The rural setting made possible for me and my brother to play in the
                streets with the other kids in the neighborhood, there were a dozen of us around the same age group.
                Today we don't see kids playing in our streets anymore, my generation was the last one to have this
                luxury. Though I had many friends, I remember that I liked to spend a lot of time with my dogs, just us.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was in first grade I started studying in a Catholic bilingual school in Curitiba called Everest
                International School, that's where Luís
                and I learned to speak English. My father used to drive me and my
                brother to school, then him or my mom would pick us up after work at the end of the day. We were
                frequently the last ones to be picked up. I remember waiting for my parents for hours, and a couple of
                times the teacher in duty had to call my parents to check if they were coming. After a few times, I
                think the teachers gave up. Because of situations
                like
                this, my brother and I were constantly hanging out together. We used to walk around the school, get in
                classrooms, play soccer, steal food from the cafeteria, and probably many other things that I don't
                remember. We also had many friends during this time, sleep overs at friends' houses were frequent and I
                still stay in touch with some of them.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the times that my mom was early to pick us up, she had a surprise for us. She took us to a
                bakery and she grabbed two drinks and a lot of food for herself. My brother and I still had
                to grab ours, but we were confused about why my mom got so much food and drinks,
                so we asked her. "Now I have to eat for two.", she said. Now I was really confused, my brother
                straight up asked if she was pregnant and she confirmed. I didn't know how to react, but the three
                of us had a group hug in the middle of the bakery.
            </p>
            <p>
                My sister was born in May, 2010. I still remember that night, . I was tired from school and
                soccer practice, so I went to bed early. The next morning my dad was supposed to wake
                us up but he didn't, nobody did. I woke up confused, tried to call them but they never answered. A
                few minutes later my dad called giving the news that my sister was born and he was in his way to
                pick us up to go to the hospital where they were. If you have to know anything about me, it's that I
                love my sister more than anything in this world. She knows that, my family knows that, everyone
                that knows me knows that.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, I changed school. Now my brother and I were studying in the Colégio Passionista Rosário, 5
                minutes drive from home. The times for this school made it possible for my brother and I to play
                soccer in the afternoons, and we still had to go to English classes when we didn't have soccer. My
                parents hated to see us not doing any activity when growing up. We were always doing something.
                Growing up I remember trying different activities like swimming, tennis, and guitar lessons. But the
                only thing we were good at was soccer. We stayed in this school for a year, then my brother received
                a scholarship to play for the International School of Curitiba. When the coaches found out I was
                also good
                at soccer they extended the scholarship to me. We were studying in the most expensive school in the
                city for 5% of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                I stayed in this school for 2 years, and my English improved a lot during this time because all of
                my classes (except Portuguese and Brazilian History) were taught in English, many of my teachers
                were Americans and I had friends from all over the world. The problem was that my brother and I
                wanted to play soccer and this school was not competitive enough, that's probably why they offered
                us scholarships. This school went from 8 am to 3:30 pm, after that I had soccer practice until 5.
                When I didn't have practice, my father would leave work early and hurry to pick us up so we
                could make to another soccer practice a few minutes away from our school and he would go back to work to
                pick us up later.
                Frequently, none of our parents could pick us up, so we would have to take the public
                transportation back home, which took us a total of 2 hours to get home. This routine was obviously not
                working, but we went with it for more than a year. My brother and I went back to Rosário,
                I remember that my dad was skeptical about this, since he knew that our chances of "succeding" were much
                higher if we stayed in the international school. But he said that if that's what we wanted, he would
                agree with it as long as we gave our best. We did.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2013 we were studying in Colombo again. School there started and ended earlier, so we had the entire
                afternoon to practice. We used to take the bus for practice,
                which was exactly 40 minutes away. Everyday, we would spend hours practicing. After practice we would
                take the bus home, or wait for one of my parents to pick us up. As usual, we never knew if they were
                coming early or if we were going to wait for hours, but waiting was always more likely to happen. We
                never cared about
                waiting on my parents, my brother and I always had a real sense of reality, we knew that they had to
                work and it was not even their obligation to pick us up. At that age we were already old enough to take
                the bus, like we did sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                [After a few years-be precise] of this, my brother received an offer to play for a club in Georgia, the
                tiny country
                close to Russia. There, they speak Georgian, and they were part of the Soviet Union. My brother went,
                until today I admire him for his courage, later his braveness would inspire me to come to the U.S. He
                went alone to a country that almost no one heard of in the other side of the planet. These were the last
                years which I got to spend the day with my brother and be with him on a daily basis. I miss those days.
            </p>
            <p>
                I continued the routine without my brother: school in the morning and soccer practice in the afternoons.
                Until one day my parents heard about this soccer tournament for people on my age that was going to
                happen in Orlando, Florida. A group of soccer coaches in Curitiba were gathering athletes to play at the
                tournament
                and also against the Montverde Academy, a boarding school known for their strong sports program. The
                goal was to
                show the athletes to the coaches at Montverde Academy and they would offer a discount in the
                tuition depending on how good the player was. I liked the idea. I was sure that I
                wanted to experience life away from home. Not because I don't like it, I LOVE IT SO MUCH, but I knew
                that I would achieve some sort of growth away from home. Being out of my comfort zone is something I
                always had, I've always felt this hunger to go do something different than what I got used to. One month
                later
                I was moving to Orlando. And at the same time my mother was moving to Portugal
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied there for 2 years, The routine and rules at Montverde were strict. If we were late for any
                class, practice, event,
                or meal we would get detention hours, and spend those hours at a classroom with no books or electronics
                or anything. We literally had to stare at the wall or at each other for 2 hours max per day, until we
                had no more detention hours to pay. We couldn't leave the school by ourselves and we had to be in bed by
                a certain time. They checked all the rooms everynight. This was not exactly the big challenge I wanted
                but I did grow a lot during this period, I learned how to study better, be more organized and punctual,
                and to adapt without depending much on my parents. During this
                period I would go back home or to Portugal in the summers and
                winters. At the end, things didn't workout for me in soccer, but I can never say that it
                was for not trying, and this always comforts me.

                I applied to the UMN as a plan B. I enrolled in the last possible day. I visited the campus by myself in
                April, during a Spring Jam weekend. If you know what Spring Jam is, you probably know how this turned
                out. The next 4 years
                happened to be much better than I've ever dreamed of. The first 2 years were of a lot of change, I
                started working and taking some challenging classes. The preparation I received at Montverde was paying
                off. My last two years were obviously marked by COVID, online classes and remote work, since then I
                started to see my family less and
                less. I spent these 2 years living at a house with 7 other guys, during the quarantine it was only me
                and Ryce, who turned to a brother for life. During these 4 years, I made
                friendships that I am sure will last my entire lifetime. I collected moments that make my entire life
                worth living. I still struggled a lot with many doubts reagarding what I wanted from life and being away
                from home. This pushed me and challenged all my beliefs about everything. Some of them got
                stronger, and some of them were replaced with new beliefs, which for me in constant change and based on
                the new
                experiences that eventually happen. Friends, moments, and growth. That's how I would describe my 4 years
                in Minnesota. Next stop, Denver, where I am as I write this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I moved here on August 1st, today is August 31st, and I spent my birthday weekend in Minneapolis. So
                honestly, it's a little early to say how things are going to be. However, the first weeks were very
                promising, I am establishing a more disciplined routine and focus more on personal projects, work,
                and education. This is the reason why I moved here, I wanted to focus more on myself and my goals.
                Let's see how this turns out :)
