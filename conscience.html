    <p> I moved to Denver on 08/01/2021 after finishing college. Moving from Minnesota to Denver was a wanted and needed
        decision. I couldn't move outside the US because Bite Squad, where I work, doesn't allow me to. The thing is
        that I needed a change in my life. With the pandemic, my lack of perspective and purpose became more evident. I
        graduated and had a job, which was my initial goal, but what now? I am supposed to work 8 hours a day, and I do
        when there's enough to keep me busy. Thankfully, the second half of the months are less stressful because the
        monthly process of closing the books is usually done in 2 weeks. I say thankfully
        because if I had to do it 8 hours per day everyday of the month it would be worse than doing nothing. The kid
        that is in me is honestly disappointed on who I am turning to, at least in terms of career. I always thought I
        was going to do something more impactful in people's lives, that is my dream, but my job doesn't allow me to do
        that. My routine was becoming boring, having all this free time, no goals, no girls, being always in the same
        environment with the same people was filling my head with anxiety and bad habits were starting to be more
        frequent. I don't blame myself, I always had too much expectations on who I want to be and what I want to do.
        Even though I was never sure, I always had this flame in me. The flame was dying. It was time for change.

        My roommate José always wanted to move to Denver, and he said he was going no matter what. He invited me, and I
        put a lot of thought into it, I initially decided to stay in Minnesota but then I decided that could be the
        change I needed. Though I don't think Denver is the greatest city out there, it would be something new in my
        life, something to look forward and to refind myself. With more time to check on myself and more time outdoors,
        in contact with nature, I believed I was going to have more space to find the answers I needed.

        Ryce and Suzanna (Jose's sister) helped José and I move in to our new place in Englewood, Colorado, 15 minutes
        South of Denver. We drove an U-Haul and José's new car, total drive was 14 hours long. I was hyped. We move in,
        Suzanna and Ryce flew back to Minnesota. Very quickly I started to miss my friends from Minnesota, and my family
        and friends at home. My birthday was going to be in a few days and my friend Sami insisted that I had to go to
        Minnesota to see her before she left for a one year trip to Mexico on a missionary work. Her persistence on
        trying to convince me made me confirm what I always knew, the distance from my family, home, and old
        friends was making me sick. Being so absent in my people's lives was also taking my purpose away from me.

        I went to Minnesota for 4 days, during those days I hung out mostly with Connor, Mitch, Alea, and Sami. These 4
        days were kind of a ritual passage that I didn't have the chance to experience the first time I said goodbye to
        them. On my birthday, Mitch's new puppy (Brooks) woke me up early, he was crying for some reason. My brother
        Luís called me that morning and I talked to my family, including my dad who was in Portugal too. After that
        Mitch made me coffee, hashbrowns, and eggs in the griddle at his backyard. We sat and talked about different
        things, it's always a good time talking to Mitch. I still had to work that day, and I did for 2 hours (lol), but
        I didn't care, that was my day, and I wanted to spend it with my friends. At noon, I went to a Van Gogh
        immersive experience with Sami and Connor. Sami got the tickets for $10 each, when they were supposed to be $40.
        It was one of the greatest experiences of art that I have lived. The paintings, the colors, and the music were
        very emotional and made me appreciate Van Gogh in a special way. This was a 360 degrees projections of
        animations made with Van Gogh's most famous paintings. The floor and the walls were all colored with Van Gogh's
        talent and emotions, it was like we were inside his paintings. Then we went to Nolo's kitchen where we got some
        delicious food. I spent the afternoon with Sami doing some stuff she had to do before she left for Mexico. To
        end the day, I gathered all my friends at Como Park. We played games, I provided snacks and beverages, we
        talked, laughed, and listened to music. After that we went to the girls' apartment above Target, in Dinkytown,
        and we had a cake that Alea prepared for me the year before. After that year, I told her I had to eat that cake
        every year for my birthday, if not I was going to be disappointed. We sang happy birthday, ate the cake, and I
        had to leave to catch my flight. José picked me up at the Denver airport, and 2 days later I am writing this.

        These 4 days made me realize how important it is for me to be present in my people's lives. Having my friends
        around make me feel alive, laughing with them, showing and receiving love keep me alive. It made me realize that
        seeing my family and visiting home more frequently could be a main ingredient that I was missing in my life's
        recipe. From now on, I will make sure to see my family and friends in every opportunity I have. I will skip
        work, school, and spend any amount of money to do it. I realized that I couldn't live without being disconnected
        from them. Thank you, Sami, for opening my eyes to this.
